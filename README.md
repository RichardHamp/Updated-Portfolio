# Updated-Portfolio
A from-scratch portfolio. 

# Results: 
I very much like the way this portfolio is coming together. I will say that it will take quite a bit longer to get it to where I would like it to be overall, but much of that time will be spent researching different aspects of the technologies that I'm unfamiliar with.

# Challenges: 
The primary challenges I faced with this dealt with a Contact Form I want to implement with Firebase. Although I believe I was closing in on the solution, I needed to comment out the code in order to turn it in for assignment. I will get back to it hopefully next week and implement that as well as some animations and such.
